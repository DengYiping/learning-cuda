* Faster matmul
There is a great write up by an engineer at Anthropic:
[[https://siboehm.com/articles/22/CUDA-MMM][blog post]] and [[https://github.com/siboehm/SGEMM_CUDA][Git repo]].

** Introduction
Matrix multiplication, or General Matrix Multiply (GEMM), is a fundamental operation in numerous computational fields, including deep learning, scientific computing, image processing, and graph analytics. The efficiency of GEMM operations often dictates the overall performance of larger applications. Given the massively parallel architecture of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), they have become the de facto hardware for accelerating these computations. Optimizing GEMM kernels on GPUs is therefore a critical area of study and engineering effort, aiming to approach the theoretical peak performance of the hardware. This document explores various stages and techniques involved in optimizing GEMM kernels using CUDA, demonstrating the iterative process from a naive implementation to highly sophisticated versions leveraging advanced hardware features.

** Helper Header Files
The matrix multiplication kernels in the `faster-matmul` directory rely on two primary helper header files: `faster_matmul.cuh` and `ptx.cuh`. These files provide common utilities and access to low-level hardware features, respectively.

*** `faster_matmul.cuh`
This header file contains common C++ and CUDA C code that is crucial for developing, testing, and benchmarking the various matrix multiplication kernels. It is included by most of the `.cu` files in the `faster-matmul` directory. Its key functionalities include:

- *CUDA Error Checking*: Provides macros like `CHECK_CUDA(ans)` that wrap CUDA API calls and automatically check for errors, printing an error message and exiting if a CUDA call fails. This is essential for robust CUDA programming.
- *Reference CPU Implementation*: Contains `cpu_matmul`, a straightforward C++ implementation of matrix multiplication. This CPU version serves as the gold standard for verifying the correctness of the results produced by the GPU kernels.
- *Result Verification*: Includes utilities like `verify_results` that compare the output matrix from a GPU kernel with the reference output from `cpu_matmul`. This function typically checks for element-wise equality within a certain tolerance to account for potential floating-point precision differences.
- *GPU Kernel Timing*: Offers functions such as `benchmark_gpu_kernel` that use CUDA events to accurately measure the execution time of GPU kernels. This is critical for performance assessment.
- *Standardized Benchmarking Framework*: Implements `run_benchmark` and `run_benchmark_gpu_only`. These functions orchestrate the entire benchmarking process:
    - Initializing input matrices (A and B) with random data on the host.
    - Allocating memory on the GPU and transferring input data from host to device.
    - Executing the specified GPU kernel (and the CPU reference if `run_benchmark` is used).
    - Transferring results from device to host.
    - Performing result verification (if CPU results are available).
    - Calculating and reporting performance metrics, primarily GFLOPS (GigaFLOPs per second).
    - Handling memory deallocation.

*** `ptx.cuh`
This header file provides a set of low-level helper functions, primarily implemented using inline PTX (Parallel Thread Execution) assembly. These functions are designed to directly access advanced hardware features available on newer CUDA architectures, particularly targeting NVIDIA's Hopper architecture and above.

The main purpose of `ptx.cuh` in this project is to enable the use of the Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA), a specialized hardware unit for efficient asynchronous data movement between global and shared memory. Key components related to TMA include:

- *Asynchronous Data Copy Wrappers*: Provides C++ wrapper functions around PTX instructions like `cp.async.bulk.tensor.2d.global.shared.b128.v1.L2::cache_hint<LOAD_CACHE_HINT_POLICY_L1_EVICT_NORMAL>.dst[SMEM].src[GMEM]` (and variants). These wrappers allow kernels to initiate asynchronous copies of 2D tiles of data from global memory to shared memory, which can then be overlapped with computation.
- *Memory Barrier (mbarrier) Management*: Includes functions for initializing and managing `mbarrier` objects directly in PTX. `mbarrier` objects are a hardware synchronization mechanism introduced with Hopper, necessary for coordinating the completion of TMA operations among threads in a warp or thread block. Functions like `mbarrier_init`, `mbarrier_arrive`, and `mbarrier_wait_parity` (or `mbarrier_wait_eq`) are provided to manage the lifecycle and synchronization points of these barriers.

This header is essential for the TMA-based kernels, such as `tma_async_matmul_wt.cu` and `tma_double_buffer_matmul.cu`, which leverage TMA for optimal data loading performance.

** Naive implementation
We launch a grid and threads along the matrix C. Basically
- ~x_C = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x~
- ~y_C = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y~

This results in the following kernel:
#+begin_src cuda
  __global__ void naive_matmul(float* A, float* B, float* C, int M, int N, int K) {
    int i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x; // Moving fast in a warp
    int j = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y; // Not moving in a warp

    if (i < M && j < N) {
      float acc = 0.0f;
      for (int k = 0; k < K; k++) {
        acc += A[i * K + k] * B[k * N + j]
      }
      C[i * N + j] = acc;
    }
  }
#+end_src

Given 2 4096 * 4096 matrices, let's calculate the number of:
- Compute: every elements will need to multiply & add with other matrix, so ~2 * 4096^3 = 137 GFLOPS~
- Theoretical read limit: ~2 * 4096^2 * 4 bytes = 128 MiB~
- Theoretical data to write: ~4096^2 * 4 bytes = 64 MiB~

On H100, it has 67 teraFLOPS / s, so in theory it can be done in ~1.9 ms~ for compute.
On H100, memory bandwidth is 3.35 TB/s, so ~40~ microseconds of memory latency. Compute is 475 times bigger

Compute / Memory ratio is 47.5. This is still compute bound in theory. If we can use < 47.5x memory access,
we would be above to achieve the best performance.

** Global memory Coalescing

32 threads in the consecutive ~threadId = threadIdx.x + threadIdx.y * blockDim.x + threadIdx.z * blockDim.x * blcokDIm.y~ can form a warp.
Within each warp, we want to have locality in terms of memory.
access across each threads.

For example, thread 0 and thread 1 should access memory near each other, and ideally all the memory accessed by 32 threads
in the warp should become a consecutive block in global memory.

The concept of a warp is relevant for this second kernel,
as sequential memory accesses by threads that are part of the same warp can be grouped and executed as one.

In the naive kernel, each threads, in the inner loop, is accessing the memory consecutively. However, across the wrap
the access is not consecutive.


All we need to do here is to swap the index of ~x~ and ~y~:
#+begin_src cuda
  __global__ void coalesced_matmul_conceptual(float* A, float* B, float* C, int M, int N, int K) {
    int i = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y; // Let i remains the same in the warp
    int j = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x; // Let j moves in the same warp

    if (i < M && j < N) {
      float acc = 0.0f;
      for (int k = 0; k < K; k++) {
        // A matrix access is not coalesed but broadcasted
        // B matrix access is coalesced
        acc += A[i * K + k] * B[k * N + j];
      }
      // Write is also coalesced
      C[i * N + j] = acc;
    }
  }
#+end_src

Note: The code snippet above illustrates the conceptual change in indexing for optimal memory coalescing. The actual `faster-matmul/coalesced_matmul.cu` file uses the original naive kernel indexing but achieves an equivalent memory access pattern by launching the CUDA grid with dimensions `gridDim(columns, rows)` instead of `gridDim(rows, columns)`. Both approaches result in thread `j` (column index) varying fastest within a warp, leading to coalesced access for matrix B and coalesced writes to matrix C.

** Shared memory tiling
*** Memory access latency:
- Register: 1 clock, 8 TB/s
- Shared memory: 32 clocks, 1.5 TB /s
- Local -> Global: 800 clocks, 200 GB / s
- Host: 5 GB/s
*** We can effectively cache the block in sram
#+begin_src cuda
  __global__ void sram_matmul(float* A, float* B, float* C, int M, int N, int K) {
    __shared__ float shared_A[BLOCK_SIZE][BLOCK_SIZE];
    __shared__ float shared_B[BLOCK_SIZE][BLOCK_SIZE];

    // threadIdx.x changes in the same warp
    int i = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int j = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;


    if (i < M && j < N) {
        // sliding window of BLOCK_SIZE x BLOCK_SIZE
        // sliding on the K dimension
        float sum = 0.0f;
        for (int w_idx = 0; w_idx < (K + BLOCK_SIZE - 1) / BLOCK_SIZE; w_idx++) {
            int k_start = w_idx * BLOCK_SIZE;

            // init shared_A, shared_B and shared_C
            // Check bounds for shared_A and shared_B, add assign value to 0 if out of bounds
            if (k_start + threadIdx.x < K) {
                shared_A[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = A[i * K + k_start + threadIdx.x];
            }

            if (k_start + threadIdx.y < K) {
                shared_B[threadIdx.y][threadIdx.x] = B[(k_start + threadIdx.y) * N + j];
            }

            __syncthreads(); // wait for all threads to finish loading data
            for (int k = 0; k < BLOCK_SIZE && (k_start + k) < K; k++) {
                sum += shared_A[threadIdx.y][k] * shared_B[k][threadIdx.x];
            }
            __syncthreads(); // avoid over-writing shared_A and shared_B before all threads finish the computation
        }
        C[i * N + j] = sum;
    }
}
#+end_src
*** Profiling the SRAM matmul kernel

Let's use the ~ncu --set full~ command to profile our kernel.
Also, use ~--generate-line-info~ for nvcc for line info.

Some of the suggestions from ncu:
**** MIO stalls
On average, each warp of this workload spends 10.2 cycles being stalled waiting for the MIO (memory input/output) instruction queue to be not full.
This stall reason is high in cases of extreme utilization of the MIO pipelines,
which include special math instructions, dynamic branches, as well as shared memory instructions. When caused by shared memory accesses, trying to use fewer but wider loads can reduce pipeline pressure.
This stall type represents about 37.3% of the total average of 27.4 cycles between issuing two instructions.

The most problematic one is ~smsp__pcsamp_warps_issue_stalled_long_scoreboard~. This indicates that we spend a lot of time loading from global memory,
and we spend a lot of time loading from SRAM as well.

** 1D block tiling kernel

We can try to calculate 8 elements in a single thread to reduce the memory pressure for accessing B shared memory:
#+begin_src cuda
template <int BM, int BN, int BK, int TM>
__global__ void block_tiling_matmul_1d(const float* __restrict__ A, const float* __restrict__ B, float* __restrict__ C, const int M, const int N, const int K) {
    __shared__ float shared_A[BM][BK];
    __shared__ float shared_B[BK][BN];

    // blockIdx.x is the block id in the N dimension, aka the column index of the block
    // blockIdx.y is the block id in the M dimension, aka the row index of the block

    // Each warp will calculate 32 * TM elements, with 32 being the columnar dim.
    // Num threads = BM * BN / TM, we will 1d tiling on the M dimension.
    const int thread_col = threadIdx.x % BN;
    const int thread_row = threadIdx.x / BN;

    // Move blocktile to beginning of A's row and B's column
    A += blockIdx.y * BM * K;
    B += blockIdx.x * BN;
    C += blockIdx.y * BM * N + blockIdx.x * BN;

    const uint inner_col_a = threadIdx.x % BK; // warp-level GMEM coalescing
    const uint inner_row_a = threadIdx.x / BK;
    const uint inner_col_b = threadIdx.x % BN; // warp-level GMEM coalescing
    const uint inner_row_b = threadIdx.x / BN;

    float thread_results[TM] = {0.0f};

    // Assume K is divisible by BK
    for (uint bkIdx = 0; bkIdx < K; bkIdx += BK) {
        // Load A and B tiles into shared memory j
        shared_A[inner_row_a][inner_col_a] = A[inner_row_a * K + inner_col_a];
        shared_B[inner_row_b][inner_col_b] = B[inner_row_b * N + inner_col_b];

        __syncthreads();

        // advance blocktile
        A += BK;
        B += BK * N;

        // Perform matrix multiplication
        for (uint dot_idx = 0; dot_idx < BK; dot_idx++) {
            // This is cached & reused for each thread in the warp
            float tmp = shared_B[dot_idx][thread_col];

            // We are reading TM elemets from A[thread_row * TM : thread_row * TM + TM][dot_idx]
            // and multiply with the cached B[thread_col][dot_idx]
            #pragma unroll
            for (uint res_idx = 0; res_idx < TM; res_idx++) {
                thread_results[res_idx] += shared_A[thread_row * TM + res_idx][dot_idx] * tmp;
            }
        }
        __syncthreads();
    }

    #pragma unroll
    for (uint res_idx = 0; res_idx < TM; res_idx++) {
        C[(thread_row * TM + res_idx) * N + thread_col] = thread_results[res_idx];
    }
}
#+end_src

Reading from the SASS code, you will notice the inner loop load from SRAM is vectorized.

Interestingly, this has no adverse effect on performance.
This is surprising since our inner two loops now incur BK (=8) * TM (=8) * 2 = 128 SMEM accesses,
instead of the previous 72. Looking at the assembly (Godbolt link) has the answer.

** 2d block tiling

Idea comes from using a outer product to do partial matrix multiplication in threads.
Each thread holds 2 vectors.

#+begin_src cuda
template <int BM, int BN, int BK, int TM, int TN>
__global__ void block_tiling_matmul_2d(const float* __restrict__ A, const float* __restrict__ B, float* __restrict__ C, const int M, const int N, const int K) {
    __shared__ float shared_A[BM][BK];
    __shared__ float shared_B[BK][BN];

    // blockIdx.x is the block id in the N dimension, aka the column index of the block
    // blockIdx.y is the block id in the M dimension, aka the row index of the block

    // Each warp will calculate 32 * TM * TN elements, with 32 being the columnar dim.
    // Num threads = BM * BN / (TM * TN), we will 2d tiling on the M, N dimension.
    const uint thread_col = threadIdx.x % (BN / TN);
    const uint thread_row = threadIdx.x / (BN / TN);

    // Move blocktile to beginning of A's row and B's column
    A += blockIdx.y * BM * K;
    B += blockIdx.x * BN;
    C += blockIdx.y * BM * N + blockIdx.x * BN;

    const uint inner_col_a = threadIdx.x % BK; // warp-level GMEM coalescing
    const uint inner_row_a = threadIdx.x / BK;
    const uint inner_col_b = threadIdx.x % BN; // warp-level GMEM coalescing
    const uint inner_row_b = threadIdx.x / BN;

    float thread_results[TM][TN] = {0.0f};
    float reg_M[TM];
    float reg_N[TN];

    const uint stride_A = blockDim.x / BK;
    const uint stride_B = blockDim.x / BN;

    // Assume K is divisible by BK. Outer loop is over block tiles
    for (uint bkIdx = 0; bkIdx < K; bkIdx += BK) {
        // Load A and B tiles into shared memory

        // For shared_A, we need to load BM * BK in total, and we've got (BM * BN) / (TM * TN) threads
        // So each thread needs to load (BM * BK) / ((BM * BN) / (TM * TN)) = BK * TM * TN / BN
        // This is equivalent to traversing on the BM dimension with stride_A = BM / (BK * TM * TN / BN) = ((BM * BN) / (TM * TN)) / BK =
        // blockDim.x / BK
        #pragma unroll
        for (int j = 0; j < BM; j += stride_A) {
            shared_A[inner_row_a + j][inner_col_a] = A[(inner_row_a + j) * K + inner_col_a];
        }
        // For shared_B, we need to load BK * BN in total, and we've got (BM * BN) / (TM * TN) threads
        // So each thread needs to load (BK * BN) / ((BM * BN) / (TM * TN)) = BK * TM * TN / BM
        // This is equivalent to traversing on the BK dimension with stride_B = BK / (BK * TM * TN / BM) = ((BM * BN) / (TM * TN)) / BN =
        // blockDim.x / BN
        #pragma unroll
        for (int j = 0; j < BK; j += stride_B) {
            shared_B[inner_row_b + j][inner_col_b] = B[(inner_row_b + j) * N + inner_col_b];
        }
        __syncthreads();
        // advance blocktile
        A += BK;
        B += BK * N;

        // Perform matrix multiplication
        #pragma unroll
        for (uint dot_idx = 0; dot_idx < BK; dot_idx++) {
            // Outer dot product over reg_M and reg_N
            #pragma unroll
            for (uint i = 0; i < TM; i++) {
                reg_M[i] = shared_A[thread_row * TM + i][dot_idx];
            }

            #pragma unroll
            for (uint j = 0; j < TN; j++) {
                reg_N[j] = shared_B[dot_idx][thread_col * TN + j];
            }

            #pragma unroll
            for (int i = 0; i < TM; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < TN; j++) {
                    thread_results[i][j] += reg_M[i] * reg_N[j];
                }
            }
        }

        __syncthreads();

            C[(thread_row * TM + i) * N + (thread_col * TN + j)] = thread_results[i][j];
        }
    }
}
#+end_src

However, with TM = TN = 4, BM = BN = 128, BK =8, we are only achieving 30% of theoretical max.

Let's do some profiling & understand.

*** Occupancy for kernel is low
We are only achieving 50% occupancy because of register pressure.
We can tune down the number of register cache by using TM = TN = 4.

** Vectorized 2d block tiling
We continue to optimize the 2d block tiling kernel by vectorizing the memory access.
Specifically, we use float4 to load 4 elements per thread for:
- Loading A tile and B tile from global memory to SRAM
- Store the result from register back to global memory


#+begin_src cuda
        // For shared_A, we need to load BM * BK in total, and we've got (BM * BN) / (TM * TN) threads
        // With vectorization, we   can load 4 elements per thread, so each thread needs to load (BM * BK) / ((BM * BN) / (TM * TN)) / 4 = BK * TM * TN / (BN * 4) times
        // This is equivalent to traversing on the BM dimension with stride_A = BM / (BK * TM * TN / (BN * 4)) = BM * BN * 4 / (BK * TM * TN) =
        // BM * BN / (TM * TN) * (4 / BK)
        // Because (BM * BN) / (TM * TN) = blockDim.x, so stride_A = blockDim.x * 4 / BK
        for (uint j = 0; j < BM; j += stride_A) {
            reinterpret_cast<float4*>(&shared_A[inner_row_a + j][inner_col_a])[0] = reinterpret_cast<const float4*>(&A[(inner_row_a + j) * K + inner_col_a])[0];
        }
        // For shared_B, we need to load BK * BN in total, and we've got (BM * BN) / (TM * TN) threads
        // With vectorization, we can load 4 elements per thread, so each thread needs to load (BK * BN) / ((BM * BN) / (TM * TN)) / 4 = BK * TM * TN / (BM * 4) times
        // This is equivalent to traversing on the BK dimension with stride_B = BK / (BK * TM * TN / (BM * 4)) = BK * BM * 4 / (BK * TM * TN) =
        // BM * BN / (TM * TN) * (4 / BN)
        // Because (BM * BN) / (TM * TN) = blockDim.x, so stride_B = blockDim.x * 4 / BN
        for (uint j = 0; j < BK; j += stride_B) {
            reinterpret_cast<float4*>(&shared_B[inner_row_b + j][inner_col_b])[0] = reinterpret_cast<const float4*>(&B[(inner_row_b + j) * N + inner_col_b])[0];
        }
#+end_src

#+begin_src cuda
    // Store the results
    for (uint i = 0; i < TM; i++) {
        for (uint j = 0; j < TN; j+= 4) {
            float4 result {thread_results[i][j], thread_results[i][j+1], thread_results[i][j+2], thread_results[i][j+3]};
            reinterpret_cast<float4*>(&C[(thread_row * TM + i) * N + (thread_col * TN)])[0] = result;
        }
    }
#+end_src

** Warp tiling kernel
Warp is a construct of CUDA that's invisible to the programmer. However, it's important for the performance of the kernel:
- Warps are the unit of scheduling that is mapped to the warp-schedulers that are part of the SM.
- Shared-memory bank conflicts (I’ll cover those in a future post) happen only between threads that are in the same warp.
- There’s a register cache on recent GPUs, and tighter threadtiling gives us more register cache locality.
- New feature called warp specialization allows us to specialize the code for each warp within a block.

Warptiling is elegant since we now make explicit all levels of parallelism:

- Blocktiling: Different blocks can execute in parallel on different SMs.
- Warptiling: Different warps can execute in parallel on different warp schedulers, and concurrently on the same warp scheduler.
- Threadtiling: (a very limited amount of) instructions can execute in parallel on the same CUDA cores (= instruction-level parallelism aka ILP).

In another perspective:
- thread  → registers
- warp    → registers plus fast register-to-register shuffle network
- block   → on-chip shared memory


Thread-tiling
What it is: Each individual thread is asked to compute a small patch (e.g., 2x2 or 4x4 results) instead of only one result.
Where data live while being reused: the thread's registers.
Purpose:
- Reuse operands several times after one load, increasing arithmetic intensity.
- Generate more independent instructions per thread (higher ILP).
- Reduce indexing/branching overhead and often produce perfectly-coalesced global accesses.

Warp-tiling
What it is: The 32 threads that execute in lock-step (a warp) cooperate on a somewhat larger tile. They usually load it with one or two coalesced transactions and then exchange the pieces each thread needs with shuffle instructions (or, in older code, with shared memory).
Where data live while being reused: registers that are exchanged through the warp-shuffle network.
Purpose:
- Let every value brought from global memory be consumed by many threads in the same warp.
- Avoid—or at least minimise—the use of shared memory for data that are only needed inside one warp, thereby saving shared-memory capacity for inter-warp reuse.
- Avoid shared-memory bank conflicts.

Block-tiling
What it is: All threads of a thread-block stage an even larger tile in shared memory, typically in several steps along a loop. Each warp then processes its own warp-tile using that shared tile as input.
Where data live while being reused: on-chip shared memory (visible to every warp in the block).
Purpose:
- Fetch each global-memory element once per block instead of once per warp or once per thread, cutting global memory traffic dramatically.
- Provide a synchronization point ( __syncthreads() ) that allows predictable, race-free reuse.
- Exploit the fact that shared memory is an order of magnitude faster than global memory.

** Double buffering – hiding memory latency with a small software pipeline

At this point our kernel is already *compute‑bound* most of the time, but every
time we move to the next K‑tile we still do the following strictly
sequentially:

1. Load `A_tile` and `B_tile` from global memory → shared memory
2. `__syncthreads()`
3. Run the inner FMAs that use that tile
4. `__syncthreads()` so that the next load does not clobber the tile we are
   still reading from

The two synchronisations mean that *all* threads in the block are stalled
during the load phases – the SM issues no arithmetic instructions while the
memory pipelines are busy, so those ~800 cycle GMEM latencies show up as very
obvious `long scoreboard` stalls in Nsight Compute.

Double buffering (sometimes called *ping‑pong buffering*) removes the
serialization by reserving **two** backing buffers in shared memory:

# +begin_example
|  A_0  |  B_0  |  A_1  |  B_1  |   ←   shared memory (one thread‑block)
            ↑          ↑
        compute   preload next tile
# +end_example

While the warps are performing the FMAs that use the data in buffer `0`, *the
same* warps start to fill buffer `1` with the data that will be needed in the
next iteration.  When the computation finishes we just flip the read/write
roles of the two buffers and continue.  The effect is a tiny software
pipeline of depth 2:

# +begin_example
Iteration i :  [ load_i   ][ compute_i ]
Iteration i+1:            [ load_{i+1}   ][ compute_{i+1} ]
# +end_example

*** Case 1 – No asynchronous copy instructions (pre-Ampere)***

On architectures that do **not** have `cp.async`/`cuda::memcpy_async` we still
benefit from double buffering because the compiler and the GPU scheduler are
able to overlap the *instruction streams* of the load loop and the compute
loop.

• Each thread issues a `ld.global` followed almost immediately by independent
  arithmetic instructions.  Since the FMA does **not** depend on the result of
  the load, the hardware scoreboard allows both to be in flight at the same
  time.
• That gives us tens of FMAs worth of *instruction-level parallelism* (ILP)
  per thread that the scheduler can use to hide the ~400-800 cycle memory
  latency.
• The overlap is not perfect – if the kernel runs out of independent
  arithmetic instructions the warp will still stall – but compared with the
  fully sequential version the stall percentage drops dramatically and the
  achieved FLOP/s goes up correspondingly.

You can observe this in Nsight Compute: the `smsp__inst_executed` metric stays
flat while `smsp__sass_average_branch_targets_threads_uniform_pct` decreases –
fewer warps are blocked on a long scoreboard.

*** Case 2 – Using `cp.async` / `cuda::memcpy_async` (Ampere +)***

Starting with Ampere the architecture exposes *asynchronous* bulk copy
instructions that transfer data from global memory to shared memory through a
dedicated *LSU pipeline*.  The key properties are:

• The instruction returns **immediately**; the thread can continue issuing
  arithmetic ops while the copy progresses in the background.
• A small in-flight queue (size ≈ 16) per warp hides the latency of the copy
  even if no other warps are ready.
• A new `cuda::pipeline` / `cp.async.wait()` API lets us express the
  producer/consumer relationship explicitly and avoid the full
  `__syncthreads()` barrier – we only need a `consumer_wait()` right before the
  tile is accessed.

With these instructions the timeline looks like this:

```
load_i (async)
                           compute_i (uses previous tile)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
consumer_wait()            load_{i+1} (async)                  compute_{i+1}
```

All the large memory latencies are now completely overlapped with useful work.
Nsight Compute will show the *memory* stall reasons dropping close to 0%, and
the kernel becomes limited by either the tensor/FMA throughput or by the
number of registers per thread (i.e. occupancy).

In practice enabling double buffering with `cp.async` tends to improve a well
tilled matmul kernel by another 1.2× – 1.4× on Ampere and Hopper GPUs.

*** Key take-aways

- Double buffering hides *compulsory* memory latency by building a tiny
  software pipeline.
- Without async copies we rely on ILP to overlap the independent load and
  compute instructions; the overlap is partial but still worthwhile.
- With async copies the overlap is explicit and nearly perfect, allowing the
  kernel to sustain throughput very close to the theoretical FMAs/clock of the
  SM.

** Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA)

Hopper GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA H100) introduce a dedicated hardware block called the
Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) that can perform asynchronous 2D bulk copies
between global memory and shared memory with minimal software overhead. We
harness TMA in the `tma_async_matmul_wt`, `tma_double_buffer_matmul`, and
`tma_double_buffer_matmul_wt` kernels by:

- Defining a tiled view of the global A and B matrices via `CUtensorMap`
  objects (created with `cuTensorMapEncodeTiled`) and marking them
  `__grid_constant__` so every thread can access the map.
- Allocating shared memory as one or two ping-pong buffers for A and B tiles.
- Initializing a software barrier (`ptx::mbarrier_init`) and using
  `ptx::mbarrier_arrive` / `ptx::mbarrier_wait_parity` to synchronize TMA
  transfers.
- Issuing TMA copy instructions with `ptx::cp_async_bulk_tensor_2d_global_to_shared`
  on the master thread to enqueue the load of each tile into shared memory.
- Overlapping copies and compute by prefetching the next tile
  (`ptx::prefetch_async_bulk_tensor_2d_global_l2`) and double buffering
  so while one tile is used in the MAC loop, the next tile is loading in
  the other buffer.

This TMA-based approach delivers near-peak shared-memory bandwidth and hides
global memory latency behind ongoing computation, boosting performance
beyond software-managed `cp.async` double buffering.

** Autotuning Kernel Parameters with `autotune_matmul.py`
Manually finding the optimal tiling parameters (`BM, BN, BK`) and thread-level parallelism parameters (`TM, TN`) for a given CUDA kernel can be a complex and time-consuming task. The best configuration is often highly specific to the GPU architecture, the nature of the kernel (e.g., if it uses double buffering, warp tiling), and even the specific matrix dimensions. The `faster-matmul/autotune_matmul.py` script provides an automated way to explore the parameter space and identify the configuration that yields the highest performance (measured in GFLOPS).

*** Functionality
The `autotune_matmul.py` script operates as follows:
1. It takes a CUDA kernel source file (e.g., `vectorized_2d_block_tiling_matmul.cu`) as input.
2. It creates a temporary copy of this source file.
3. Within this temporary copy, it systematically modifies the `constexpr` definitions for parameters like `BM` (Block M dimension), `BN` (Block N dimension), `BK` (Block K dimension), `TM` (Thread M dimension), and `TN` (Thread N dimension). It iterates through ranges defined within the script.
4. For each parameter combination, it compiles the modified kernel using `nvcc`.
5. It then executes the compiled kernel, typically performing a matrix multiplication.
6. The script parses the standard output of the kernel execution, looking for a GFLOPS (GigaFLOPs per second) metric.
7. It keeps track of the parameter set that achieves the highest GFLOPS and reports this best configuration upon completion.

*** Key Features/Usage
The script includes several features to guide the tuning process and handle different kernel types:

- *Configurable Parameter Ranges*: Inside the script, users can define the search space for each parameter (e.g., `BM_RANGE = [32, 64, 128, 256]`, `BK_RANGE = [8, 16, 32, 64]`).
- *Constraint Checking*: Before attempting to compile and run, the script performs several checks to ensure the validity of a parameter combination:
    - *Shared Memory Usage*: Calculates the required shared memory based on `BM, BN, BK` and whether the `use_double_buffer` flag is set. It skips configurations that would exceed the available shared memory per SM (Streaming Multiprocessor).
    - *Max Threads Per Block*: Ensures that `(BM / TM) * (BN / TN)` does not exceed the GPU's maximum threads per block limit.
    - *Estimated Register Pressure*: While not a perfect measure, it can provide heuristics to avoid configurations likely to lead to excessive register spilling (though this is more implicitly handled by performance measurement).
    - *Specific Kernel Constraints*: For example, it often enforces `BK % 4 == 0` if the kernel uses `float4` vectorization for the K dimension.
- *Command-Line Options*:
    - `source_file`: (Positional argument) Specifies the path to the CUDA kernel file to be tuned.
    - `--headers`: Allows specifying a comma-separated list of header files required by the kernel (e.g., `faster_matmul.cuh, ptx.cuh`).
    - `--gpus`: Defines which GPU(s) to use for tuning (e.g., `0` or `0,1`). The script typically runs benchmarks on each specified GPU sequentially.
    - `--double_buffer`: A flag indicating that the kernel uses double buffering, which affects shared memory calculations (doubling the requirement for A and B tiles).
    - `--warptiling`: A flag that adjusts the tuning strategy for warp-tiled kernels. When enabled, it often fixes `TM` and `TN` to values suitable for warp-level operations (e.g., `TM=BM/WARP_SIZE_M`, `TN=BN/WARP_SIZE_N` assuming a warp is processing a tile) and primarily varies the block dimensions (`BM, BN, BK`).

*** Conceptual Example Command
To autotune the `vectorized_2d_block_tiling_matmul.cu` kernel, which uses double buffering and requires `faster_matmul.cuh`, on GPU 1, you might run:
#+begin_src bash
python faster-matmul/autotune_matmul.py faster-matmul/vectorized_2d_block_tiling_matmul.cu --headers faster-matmul/faster_matmul.cuh --gpus 1 --double_buffer
#+end_src

*** When to Use
Autotuning is particularly beneficial in the following scenarios:
- *Maximizing Performance*: When aiming to extract the highest possible performance from a specific kernel on a target GPU architecture.
- *Porting Kernels*: When adapting an optimized kernel from one GPU generation to another, as optimal parameters often change.
- *Exploring Non-Obvious Configurations*: The script can systematically test a wide range of parameters, potentially uncovering effective combinations that might not be intuitive through manual tuning.
- *Complex Kernels*: For kernels with many tunable parameters and intricate dependencies, manual tuning becomes exceedingly difficult.

*** Output
The script prints the GFLOPS achieved for each valid parameter combination it tests. At the end of the tuning process, it outputs:
- The set of parameters (`BM, BN, BK, TM, TN`) that yielded the best GFLOPS.
- The maximum GFLOPS value achieved with that configuration.
This information can then be used to hardcode the optimal parameters into the production version of the kernel or to select the best pre-compiled version.
